Languages: Python, (you can add more: R, SQL, etc)
Libs & Frameworks: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Areas of Interest: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, Computer Vision, NLP
Other tools: Git, GitHub, version control, data preprocessing, visualization
Projects & Learning Stages
This repo is organized into stages:

Stage	Focus	What Youâ€™ll Find
01_Libraries	Basic foundational tools	Notebooks & README covering libraries like NumPy, Pandas etc
02_Basic_Machine_Learning	Classic ML models	Regression, classification, clustering examples
03_Neural_Networks	Introduction to NNs	Simple network architectures, backpropagation, etc
04_Advanced_Deep_Learning	Complex models	CNNs, RNNs, advanced architectures
05_Big_Projects	Real project implementations	End-to-end notebooks, readmes, documentation
What Iâ€™m Learning Now
Currently I am working on:

End-To-End Deployment of Models
Building portfolio projects for real-world applications
